# RAM Limiter

This mod forces levels to stay within a RAM limit. 

Counterintuitive you'd think since GD just became 64 bit on Windows, but some levels can exponentially use up your ram, and you don't want your whole PC crashing due to a GD level. 

With this mod, you can set the limit from 128 MiB to any higher value. 

For example: 1 GiB is 1024 MiB, and by default, this is set to a limit of 4 GiB (4096 MiB).
